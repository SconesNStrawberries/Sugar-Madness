## [NYC 311 Customer Survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_yhodbfNVuk6EmkKw1EmDwqMifFzOBZ7isYoeFnagnM/edit?usp=sharing)
- On June 29 of 2025, NYC has published a [public dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/311-customer-satisfaction-survey) on **DATA.GOV** about customer satisfaction survey results throughout **2020-2024**.
- This dataset gave me an insight into customer psychology. NPS, or Net Promoter Score is a numerical value of public trust and satisfaction with NYC311 rated by customer.
- Using pivot table, functions and filtering I was able to retrieve a strong correlation between each categorized criterias, customer respond stats, survey language usage, and NPS trend by year.
